#I am using SQL to extract statistical information about customer and order data from a database containing several tables.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <>'Order ID';

#2.How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <>'Order ID'
AND Product='iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT  distinct customers.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID= customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <>'Order ID'
AND orderID <>'';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT JanSales.product,JanSales.price AS CheapestProduct
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
order by price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product in January?

SELECT JanSales.Product,SUM(JanSales.Quantity)*Price as Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
HAVING orderID <> 'Order ID' 
AND orderID <>'';


#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT FebSales.Product,FebSales.location,FebSales.Quantity,FebSales.price,SUM( FebSales.Quantity*FebSales.Price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderID <>'Order ID'
AND orderID <>''
AND location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum),AVG(FebSales.Quantity*FebSales.price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> '';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, location,sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
