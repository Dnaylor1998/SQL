# Dwaylin Naylor's SQL Porfolio
SQL Portfolio

**Welcome to my SQL portfolio! I am excited to share with you the projects I have completed and the skills I have developed through my experience with SQL. With this portfolio, I hope to demonstrate my ability to efficiently manage databases, manipulate data, and generate meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Through my projects, you will see how I have used SQL to extract and transform data, build relationships between tables, and create queries that answer important business questions. I have experience with a range of SQL tools and techniques, including data modeling, data warehousing, and data visualization.

I hope you find my portfolio to be informative, comprehensive, and reflective of the skills and knowledge I have gained in using SQL. I would be delighted to receive your feedback and answer any questions you may have via email : Dwaylin.naylor@gmail.com

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work.
